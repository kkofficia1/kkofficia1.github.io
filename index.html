            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me-content">My interrest in technology was always there. It started while playing different video games or being the one in the family who could always help if there where any problems.<br> In 2019, I started my studies in economy. The program was in cooperation with Deutsche Telekom AG, where I started learning about Sales. I stayed in Sales until the first move into a new department had to be done. There, I went into social media marketing at TechBoost, Telekom's startup accelerator programm. I was able to connect with many startups and understand their business idea and technology. During this time, I started learning about blockchain and data analysis. My most important skill till today is my analytical thinking. It is very intriguing for me to wrap my head around certain topics and find ways to improve. After finishing my study program in business administration, I started my first "real" job. Telekom employed me as a business manager, which was a staff role in a team which was supporting the management team of a department. There, I started learning to code and implemented some ways to automate administrative tasks with Microsoft Power Automate. Also during that time, I started learning python with Codecademy and then switched over to the webdevelopment carreer path. Which taught me how to create websites and style them. I also learned JavaScript. For me, coding is something really enjoyable. I love to dive into projects and learn new topics. My strong analytical skills are helping me find solutions in difficult scenarios. My goal is to further deepen my knowledge in a full-time role as a software engineer.</p>
